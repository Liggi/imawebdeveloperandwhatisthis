# HTML

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's based on a language
called XML, which defines a set of rules for formatting documents in a
way that is both human and machine readable.

It looks like this:

  <div class="container">
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This is an extremely basic example of an HTML document.</p>
  </div>

In the example above, a "div" (a container unit) is defined with a class
of "container". This class can be (almost) anything, and is commonly used as a
"hook" for other web languages, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and
JavaScript. Within the div, we have two elements:

- An "h1" element, which defines a "heading level one" (one being the
  most important)
- A "p" tag, which stands for "paragraph", which denotes a paragraph of
  content.
