# I'm a web developer and what is this
Explaining web development in simple English.

## Rules

- Each explanation should stand on its own. No "HTML is like XML, but
  for the web".
- If knowledge/understanding of something else is required to understand
  your explanation, you can link to the relevant dependent explanations.
- Avoid web specific nomenclature, no "opinionated", no "isomorphic".
